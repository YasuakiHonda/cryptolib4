# cryptolib4
Implementation of [JoeyLupo's cryptolib](https://github.com/JoeyLupo/cryptolib) in Lean4.

This project aims to implement the game-based semantically secure and proof of correctness of the ElGamal public key encryption scheme.

## Getting started
You can download the whole folder structure as a zip file by pressing Code button and choose "Download ZIP".
Then you need to expand the zip to a folder. As the successful CI workflow creates the latest cache, you can invoke the following commands in the folder
to fetch them.  
  % lake exe cache get  
  % lake build  

After things are done, you can open the folder using VSCode to start !
